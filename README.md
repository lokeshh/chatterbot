#Simple AI chatter bot that learns as we talk 
 
It   involves   writing   an   AI   bot   that   will   communicate   with   a   user   like   any   other   person   in   the  
following manner: 
 
YOU: Hi 
BOT: Hello 
YOU: What are you doing? 
BOT: Nothing... just talking to you 
 
The   common   responses   will   be   saved   in   a   file   and   will   be   loaded   into   memory   at   time   of  
execution.   When   a   user   inputs   a   string,   it   will   search   in   it’s   memory.   If   a   response   is   found,   it   will  
give it to the user. Otherwise, it will search for the most relevant response. 
 
Dictionary   can   be   used   to   search   responses   in   the   memory   and   the   sentence   which   user  
submits   can   be   broken   down   into   strings   and   saved   as   a   list   to   be   used   to   find   an   optimal  
response.
